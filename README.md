# _Programming Language Selector_

#### By **Jarret Jeter**

#### _This is a short survey webpage to help a user decide their first programming language to learn._

## Technologies Used

* _HTML_
* _CSS_
* _Bootstrap_
* _Javascript_
* _Jquery_

## Description

_This webpage uses javascript to check the radio buttons assigned to a corresponding language for their value if checked, and to assign that value to a variable. If a radio button isn't checked, its value will be 0. These values are then added to the appropriate language's variable (i.e totalJavaValue or totalPyValue). Lastly, those summed values will be compared with each other to return a result to the user._

## Setup/Installation Requirements
